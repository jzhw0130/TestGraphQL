# TestGraphQL
GraphGL with Objective C


### Server

This app talks to the frontpage example server, available here: https://github.com/apollostack/frontpage-server. Follow the instructions there and start the server before running the iOS app. (You can find the equivalent React app [here](https://github.com/apollostack/frontpage-react-app) if you want to run them side by side.)
